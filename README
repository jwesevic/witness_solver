Requires a valid installation of Gurobi to run.

Usage: run witnessSolver using python.  
    There are two arguments: 
        (required) the first is a path to a .json file which represents a puzzle (no validity checking is done on the puzzle)
        (optional) the second is the name of the file where output will be written.
    output consists of a .txt file which contains a graphical representation of the path taken, along with all nodes used along the way
        and connected component data.  NOTE: connected component data may not be accurate in all cases right now!  inclusion should
        always be correct but exclusion may not be!

example usage:

py .\witnessSolver.py .\cell_block.json cell_block.txt

will run witnessSolver on the puzzle represented by cell_block.json, then write output to cell_block.txt.
