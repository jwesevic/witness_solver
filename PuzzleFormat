size key is an array where the first elt is the height (number of rows) and the second elt is the width (number of columns)
starts key is an array of points (which themselves are arrays) at which we can start
ends key is an array of points (whichthemselves are arrays) at when we can ends
hexagons is an dictionary with 2 keys:
    corners key is an array of points at which there are hexes
    edges key is an array of points+directions which represent edges which have hexes
breaks is an array of points+directions which represent edges which have breaks
grid is a n by m nested array where each entry is a dictionary with 1 key
    compenent key is blank if there is no puzzle component at that location, and a dictionary if there is
        subdictionary contains 3 keys:
